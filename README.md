<h2>Summary</h2>
This was a solo developed entry for Interstellar Game Jam 2: Time Control. This project was made in 5 days with all programming and 
design being done by myself. Music and sound effects were acquired from online sources. The vast majority of art assets were acquired from online sources.
Post jam updates such as improved art and an epilogue have been added as well.

Jupiter serves as a guardian angel of sorts for the terrestrial planets. It keeps debris from colliding with other planets because of its massive gravity 
sucking that debris in... Or perhaps there is another reason?

Stop the asteroids from reaching the bottom of the screen by shooting them or getting them caught in your gravitational field. Launch sideways to 
catch stray asteroids and slow down time. Time slows more the further you launch. Time speeds back up  as you return to the center. You may not launch 
yourself when not in the center of the screen.

<h2>New Repository Update</h2>
<p>This project came from a previous repository that contained 3rd party assets. Most art, music, and sfx files have now been witheld from the repository for redistribution purposes. The following package was used to create certain materials for the game. The materials will be absent in this version.</p>
